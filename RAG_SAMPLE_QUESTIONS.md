## Tips for Better RAG Results

1. **Use natural language**: Questions should be phrased naturally, not as keyword searches
2. **Ask conceptual questions**: RAG works best with questions about concepts, explanations, and relationships
3. **Avoid exact matches**: The system should find semantically similar content even if wording differs
4. **Use Bulgarian**: All questions should be in Bulgarian to match the document language
5. **Be specific but not too narrow**: Questions should be specific enough to find relevant content but broad enough to allow semantic matching

## Expected Behavior

- **Semantic matching**: The system should find relevant content even when exact words don't match
- **Context understanding**: The system should understand context and relationships
- **Multi-document synthesis**: The system should combine information from multiple document chunks when needed
- **Bulgarian language support**: The system should handle Bulgarian language nuances and variations
